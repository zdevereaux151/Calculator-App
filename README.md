# Java Swing Calculator

## Overview
This project is a desktop calculator application built using **Java Swing**. It provides a clean and familiar calculator interface with support for basic arithmetic operations and common calculator utilities.

The program demonstrates GUI design, event handling, and basic expression evaluation in Java.


## Features

### Arithmetic Operations
- Addition (`+`)
- Subtraction (`-`)
- Multiplication (`x`)
- Division (`÷`)
- Equals (`=`)

### Utility Functions
- **AC** – Clears all values and resets the display
- **+/-** – Toggles the sign of the current number
- **%** – Converts the current number into a percentage

### Display Behavior
- Prevents multiple decimals in the same number
- Shows the active operator in the display (e.g., `12 + 3`)
- Formats results to remove unnecessary `.0` from whole numbers
